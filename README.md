## Introduction

Droid support:
- The Customisation of Recommender Systems for a particular modelling language.
- Assistance on the decision of which recommendation method works better for the recommendation task;
- Generation of customized recommendation services that can be integrated with external modelling tools.

Droid is composed mainly of an Eclipse Textual Domain-specific language (DSL) that is the hearth of the Droid configurator. The configurator allows, via the DSL, the configuration of RSs for a particular modelling language, from preference settings to full performance evaluation. The selected recommendation method is deployed as a service; which then heterogeneous modelling clients can integrate.

Currently, we provide automated, out-of-the-box integration with the tree editor of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). But additionally, the generated recommenders can be integrated with other modelling technologies.
