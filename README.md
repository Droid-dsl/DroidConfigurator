## Droid
<p align="left">
<a href="https://droid-dsl.github.io/" style="color:purple;">Droid</a> is a framework designed to automate the configuration, evaluation, and synthesis of recommender systems for modelling languages. The framework offers support for:

 - Customizing recommender systems to a particular modelling language
 - Helping users choose the best recommendation method for their task
 - Generating customized recommendation services that can be integrated with external modelling tools
 </p>

Droid's Eclipse Textual Domain-specific language (DSL) is the centrepiece of the configurator, enabling users to configure every aspect of the recommender system, including defining the types of recommended modelling elements, gathering and preprocessing training data, configuring recommendation methods, and defining metrics for evaluating the resulting recommender system. The selected recommendation method is deployed as a service, which can be integrated with various heterogeneous modelling clients. Additionally, the language can be extended with new data sources and recommendation methods.

Currently, Droid offers automated, out-of-the-box integration with the tree editor of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), and the generated recommenders can also be integrated with other modelling technologies

## Data

<p align="left">
The data used for our evaluations is located within the 'Data' folder, which is named according to the training date. Inside, you'll find a 'dataset' folder containing the models or metamodels used for training, as well as a 'results' folder with the corresponding result data.
  
  - 202205: Contains the evaluation data presented in our paper titled 'Building Recommender Systems for Modeling Languages with Droid'. 
  - 202303: Contains the evaluation data for a journal publication currently under review by the Empirical Software Engineering journal.
